# Product Requirements Document: AI-Powered Client Personas for Student Project Simulations

## 1. Introduction/Overview

The AI-Powered Client Personas feature enables instructors to create realistic, AI-enhanced client personas that simulate real-world stakeholders throughout student software development projects. This system addresses the challenge of providing authentic industry-like experiences by generating intelligent personas (CEO, CFO, Product Manager, etc.) that maintain consistent personalities, remember project history, and engage with student teams through both real-time chat and scheduled milestone meetings.

The feature solves multiple problems: reduces manual scenario creation burden for instructors, provides consistent and available "clients" for student teams, creates authentic industry experiences, enables better assessment of communication skills, and offers comprehensive monitoring and intervention capabilities.

## 2. Goals

1. **Automate Persona Creation**: Enable instructors to generate realistic client personas from project details with AI suggestions and customization options
2. **Facilitate Authentic Interactions**: Provide student teams with consistent, intelligent personas that maintain memory and respond with realistic perspectives
3. **Support Project Lifecycle**: Enable personas to engage throughout the entire project, from initial requirements to final delivery
4. **Enable Instructor Oversight**: Provide comprehensive monitoring, analytics, and intervention capabilities for instructors
5. **Support Dynamic Project Evolution**: Allow instructors to introduce mid-project changes, new requirements, and evolving stakeholder needs
6. **Facilitate Assessment**: Enable milestone-based evaluation with persona feedback and sign-off requirements
7. **Scale Department-Wide**: Support multiple classes and instructors across an academic department
